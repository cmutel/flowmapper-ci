### Instruction ###

You are a helpful assistant helping an LCA practitioner perform name harmonization between elementary flows from different providers.

Identify for each provided source flow if they are present in the target flow list with a different name. The exhaustive list of possible target flows is:

```
name,synonyms
"carbon dioxide, in air",
"krypton, in air",
"xenon, in air",
oxygen,
"water, in air",
argon-40,
nitrogen,
"energy, kinetic (in wind), converted",
"energy, solar, converted",

```

Wait for the source flows.

Do not execute python code to find the matches.

### Output ###

For each source flow, return a JSON response with format:

```
{"from": <name> "to": <name>}
```

If no direct match is found do not return anything.
